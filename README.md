# radar_DSM
generate Digital Surface Models from Capella and TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X SAR imagery

# USAGE
radar_DSM is a Python package for generating Digital Surface Models (DSMs) from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data using stereo radargrammetry. The module has been tested on the following data formats:

Capella Space:
        Geocoded Ellipsoid Corrected:
                -Stripmap
                -Spotlight
                -Sliding Spotlight

TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X:
        Geocoded Ellipsoid Corrected
                -Stripmap

The methodology of the package is described in: S. Beninati and S. Frasier, "A radargrammetry algorithm for high-resolution SAR satellite constellations," unpublished.
